# Prediction_of_Concrete_Compressive_Strength

##
This is my graduation project. The scope of the is estimating the concrete compressive strength. We analyzed the parameters affecting the durability of concrete and performed a regression analysis with the data we have. We worked on 3 different models in the project, this repo is the part I'm working on.
